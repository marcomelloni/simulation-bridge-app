simulation:
  request_id: abcdef12345
  # (RequestID) to identify each request.

  timestamp: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  # Timestamp for the simulation request in ISO 8601 format

  timeout: 30
  # Timeout for the simulation in seconds

  client_id: dt
  # Unique identifier of the sender of this simulation request

  simulator: matlab
  # Specifies the target system for the simulation.
  # Use 'matlab' to route the request to the MATLAB simulator.

  type: streaming
  # Specifies the simulation execution mode.
  # Options:
  #   - 'batch': runs the simulation in batch mode, where results are returned only after the entire computation is complete.
  #   - 'streaming': runs the simulation in streaming mode, providing real-time updates at each computation step.
  #   - 'interactive': same as 'streaming', where you need to provide a continuous stream of inputs and outputs.

  file: SimulationStreaming.m
  # The name of the MATLAB script or function file to execute for this simulation.

  inputs:
    # Input variables to be passed to the simulation.
    # If the simulation type is 'streaming' or 'interactive', it is mandatory to specify 'stream_source' to indicate the source of the input stream.
    # stream_source: The source of the input stream, e.g., RabbitMQ, which streams real-time input data to the simulation.
    # This is required for interactive or streaming simulations.
    stream_source: # Source of the input stream, typically RabbitMQ for streaming mode.
