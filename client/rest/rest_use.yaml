# REST client configuration

# 1. URL
#    • Use "https://" for a TLS connection.
#    • Use "http://" if you want to completely disable TLS
#      (the server must obviously also expose HTTP).
#
# 2. ssl_verify
#    This field controls **certificate verification** on the client side.
#
#      false  ──► TLS without any verification (DO NOT use in production)
#      true   ──► Verification with the operating system's trust store
#                (works only with certificates signed by public CAs
#                 or internal CAs already installed in the system).
#      <path> ──► Verification enabled and, additionally, considers trusted
#                the specified PEM certificate/CA (useful for self-signed).
